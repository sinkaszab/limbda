# fmin

## Rationale

After having implemented array reduce with using ES6 features I remembered while having worked with Clojure for a while how nice it was that collection transformations could be done on any type of collection. This library aims to extend some transformations for all collection types as well as implements some functional programming paradigms to make function composing easier.

The aim is not to imlement a Lisp-ish JavaScript.

## State

Current implementations were not yet benchmarked, so it can easily happen you'll meet performance issues. Breaking changes might happen. This library is yet in its very-very early stage.

## Usage

Get package from npm:

`npm install fmin`

As you would import any other packege in Node.js, eg.:

`const fmin = require('fmin');`
